conversion rates between Control (PSA) and Test (Ad) groups.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

## Key Steps
- Data loading and preprocessing

- Hypothesis testing using t-test
- Confidence interval estimation
- Visualization of results

## Result
The Test group shows a higher conversion rate than the Control group.
The p-value is significantly less than 0.05, indicating a statistically
significant difference. The Test version is recommended.
